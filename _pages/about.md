I am an Assistant Professor of Microelectronics Thrust at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Prior to joining HKUST(GZ), I held the position of Principal Engineer at Hisilicon, working on accelerator design for the next-generation DPU. I received my Ph.D. in computer science from National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2022, where I was supervised by [Prof. Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/) and collaborated closely with [Prof. Weng-Fai WONG](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~wongwf/) and [Prof. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/).
