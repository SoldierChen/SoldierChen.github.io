I am an *Assistant Professor* of Microelectronics Thrust at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Prior to joining HKUST(GZ), I held the position of Principal Engineer at [Hisilicon](https://www.hisilicon.com/en/), working on accelerator design for the next-generation DPU. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/) in 2022, where I was supervised by [Prof. Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/) and collaborated closely with [Prof. Weng-Fai WONG](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~wongwf/) and [Prof. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/). You can find my resume [here](#).


The primary objective of my research is to develop sustainable computing solutions by leveraging the power of hardware acceleration and system optimization. **My research interest lies predominantly in algorithm-hardware co-design, FPGA-based acceleration, heterogeneous computing, and system design.**

<b>I am actively looking for self-motivated PhD students and research assistants. Please feel free to email me your CV if you are interested in my research.</b>

<!--- My interest lies predominantly in exploring the potential of algorithm-hardware co-designed accelerators for a wide range of areas, including but not limited to, graph analytics, big data processing, and machine learning. --->
